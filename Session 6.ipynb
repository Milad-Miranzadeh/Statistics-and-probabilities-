    "# Uniform Distribution\n",
    "We can define a continuous random variable based on its probability density function (PDF). This PDF is sort of proportional to the probability that the random variable will take a particular value. The key idea is that if you integrate the PDF over an interval, it gives you the probability that the random variable will take a particular value.Let's consider a uniform distribution. When X is distributed uniformly between 0 and 1. It can take any value between 0 and 1 and they are equally likely.\n",
