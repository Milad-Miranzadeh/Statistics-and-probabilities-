    "# Session 4- Bayes's theorem \n",
    "Bayes theorem used to reverse the direction of conditioning. Suppose we want to ask what is the probability of P(A|B) but we know it in terms of P(B|A). We can calculate the given probability:\n",
    "$$ P(A|B)= \\frac {P(B|A).P(A)}{P(B|A).P(A)+P(B|A^c).P(A^c)}$$\n",
    "In the example of session 3, we can say P(F|CS) can be translated as the probability of CS majors given that they are female (P(CS|F)), so the probability of P(F|CS) is:\n",
    "$$P(CS|F)= \\frac {P(F|CS).P(CS)}{P(F|CS).P(CS)+P(F|CS^c).P(CS^c)} $$\n",
    "$$ P(CS|F)= \\frac {(1/3).(12/30)}{(1/3).(12/30)+(5/18).(18/30)}= \\frac {4}{9}$$\n",
    "## Example-1\n",
    "The probability of someone test positive given HIV (P(+|HIV)) was 0.977.The probability of someone test negative given they don't have HIV (P(-|HIV)) was 0.926. A study found thta among North Americans, the probability that a north American would have HIV is about 0.0026.\n",

    "Bayes theorem is an important part of our approach to the Bayesian statistics. We can use it to update our information. We can start with prior beliefs, we'll collect data and we'll conditioned on the data to lead our posterior beliefs. Bayes theorem is The coherent way to update our beliefs. "
